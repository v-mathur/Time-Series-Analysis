# Time-Series-Analysis
Problem Statement:

Unicorn Investors wants to make an investment in a new form of transportation - JetRail. JetRail uses Jet propulsion technology to run rails and move people at a high speed! The investment would only make sense, if they can get more than 1 Million monthly users within next 18 months. In order to help Unicorn Ventures in their decision, we need to forecast the traffic on JetRail for the next 7 months. We are provided with traffic data of JetRail since inception in the test file.
Various models have been used for the analysis of time series to reduce the root mean square error.
